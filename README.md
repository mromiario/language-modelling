<h1>Language Modelling</h1>
<p>In this repository, I build Bahasa Indonesia Language Modelling to predict next term that would appear and use preplexity to
evaluate the system.
</p>
<p>The data used in building the bigram system is taken from a collection of news on the topic of lifestyle on the national news site okezone.com. News retrieval is done by crawling using scrapy at the address http://www.lifestyle.okezone.com, and taken 100 news to be used as a dataset. Crawling results are stored in a .csv table which is then stored as .xlsx.</p>
